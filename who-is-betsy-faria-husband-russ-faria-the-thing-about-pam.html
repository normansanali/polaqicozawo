Russ, her husband, was wrongfully convicted in 2013 but was acquitted after a retrial. Pam Hupp was the real killer at that period, and she was only recently convicted of Betsy Faria’s murder last summer.</p><p>Betsy’s friend Pam Hupp quickly put the finger at Betsy’s husband, Russ Faria, after she was found dead in her Missouri home on Dec. 27, 2011, after being stabbed a horrific 55 times.</p><p>Despite the numerous discrepancies and flaws in her testimony, he became the lone murder suspect and Hupp the prosecution’s star witness.</p><p>Russ Faria was convicted of murder and sentenced to three years in prison before his conviction was reversed in 2015.</p><p>“I don’t know what this woman has in for me, I’ve only met her maybe a half dozen times if that, but she wants to keep throwing me under the bus for something I didn’t do,” Russ said of Hupp in an interview with&nbsp;People.</p><p>In a civil action, Russ was given a $2 million out-of-court settlement against three policemen engaged in the investigation of his wife’s death, whom he claimed “manufactured evidence” and “failed to examine the other apparent possibility.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-thing-about-pam-plot-%e2%80%93-explained></span>The Thing About Pam Plot – Explained<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Thing About Pam is a true-crime podcast investigating Betsy Faria’s murder in 2011. Russ Faria, her husband, is eventually prosecuted and convicted of her murder, despite his denials.</p><p>When additional inquiry led to Pam Hupp and a plot to frame Russ, he was acquitted. Keith Morrison hosts the show, which is produced by Dateline NBC.

Morrison began his career as a reporter and anchor at local stations in Saskatchewan, Vancouver, British Columbia, and Toronto, Ontario, in the 1960s.</p><p>When Betsy Faria is murdered in small-town Missouri, the police assume it’s an open-and-shut case involving her husband, who was caught and convicted of the crime, according to the&nbsp;program.</p><p>However, there are still unsolved problems, and the case not only results in a wrongful conviction but it also puts in motion a series of events that reveals a nefarious conspiracy involving Betsy’s close friend Pam Hupp.</p><p>Pam, who was the last person to see Betsy alive, was not considered a suspect and constantly altered her narrative as she evaded questioning and takes detectives through a terrifying sequence of unforeseen twists and turns.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ybnK2rqWKzor7ImmShraOXrq%2BwjKusrKtdm66ztcBmq6GdXam1qrrGZpibp6WperGtzGg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-stephanie-halcro-know-her-age-and-bio-meet-her-on-instagram.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Stephanie Halcro?
