tough to look away from <a href=#>the&nbsp;chaotic&nbsp;mess</a> of changing&nbsp;allies and shocking betrayals that dominated the season. <strong>Jen</strong>, <strong>Lisa</strong>, <strong>Meredith</strong>, <strong>Whitney</strong>, <strong>Heather</strong>, and <strong>Mary</strong>, the season's leading ladies, had plenty on their plates between new business ventures, wild dance parties, and over-the-top dates and excursions, and watching it all go down was like eating the most delicious junk food - knowing it's bad for you, but completely unable to stop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Housewives Of Salt Lake City Sorted Into Their Hogwarts Houses</a></span></p><p>All six of the women are wives and mothers, and the families often get pulled into the drama, sometimes unwittingly and sometimes of their own volition. <a href=#>The kids on the show</a> play only a peripheral role -&nbsp;well, besides Meredith's son Brooks&nbsp;- but you have to wonder what the offspring of these women is like. Are they anything like their parents, or have they somehow managed to avoid the same messy fate? Here's what we know about the children of&nbsp;Real Housewives: Salt Lake City.</p><h2 id=lisa-barlow-s-son-jack><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Lisa Barlow's Son,&nbsp;Jack</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At 16, Lisa Barlow's older son Jack is becoming an adult and finding out who he is going to be in the world. His parents are successful businesspeople: John and Lisa have a tequila company together and John also owns an investment company. Jack is trying his hand at business too and recently launched a line of <a href=#>men's grooming products</a> with his younger brother.</p><h2 id=lisa-s-barlow-s-son-henry><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Lisa's Barlow's Son, Henry</span></h2><p>9-year-old Henry is Lisa's younger son and Jack's business partner in their company Fresh Wolf. He's got a charming little smile and lots of charisma. Lisa has no doubt instilled her work ethic in him, often telling him, "You can anything you want in life if you're willing to work." At one point, he shoots back telling her that what he "wants in life" is a McLaren. Okay, business kid!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=meredith-marks-son-brooks><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Meredith Marks' Son, Brooks</span></h2><p>Brooks Marks is without a doubt the <a href=#>breakout star of the season</a>. Fans fell in love with Brooks Marks when the gay 21-year-old was frequently seen advising or snarking at his mom Meredith in his signature apathetic monotone.&nbsp;One episode revolves around the fashion show for the clothing line he designed, and whether or not his dad will be in attendance. Fans have called for a Brooks Marks spinoff - and they're not wrong!</p><h2 id=meredith-marks-daughter-chloe><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Meredith Marks' Daughter, Chloe</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meredith's daughter Chloe has recently left their house to live on her own, so we haven't seen much of her yet. She is a model and frequently takes to Instagram to post high-fashion outfits and looks. She also runs an account called @WhatChloeCraves, which is just...pictures of&nbsp;food&nbsp;she eats? It only has a couple hundred followers, so it seems to just be a passion project.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>These Former 'Real Housewives' Stars Have Said They Would Return To The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=jen-shah-s-son-sharieff-jr><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jen Shah's Son, Sharieff Jr.</span></h2><p>Perhaps <a href=#>the&nbsp;wildest&nbsp;of all the Housewives</a> this season, Jen and her husband, known affectionately as "Coach Shah," share two sons, the older of which is Sharieff, Jr. The 27-year-old followed in&nbsp;the footsteps of his father, who is a college football recruiter. He&nbsp;was a running back on the football team at&nbsp;Utah State University.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jen-shah-s-son-omar><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jen Shah's Son, Omar</span></h2><p>Omar was featured in the first episode of the season when Jen is shocked to learn that the 15-year-old has a girlfriend. When he admits he has not kissed her yet, Jen is relieved, but she causes controversy by telling him that "you can contract herpes, and probably AIDS." Omar dismisses the idea, but it's unlikely it will even come into play - his position on his high school's football team may keep him too busy for a long term girlfriend.</p><h2 id=heather-gay-s-daughters-ashley-georgia-and-annabelle><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Heather Gay's Daughters, Ashley, Georgia, and Annabelle</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Okay, we have to cheat a little bit to get all these kids in! But Heather's three daughters are so close, they might as well be one person anyway. At 17, Ashley has just graduated from high school and has a boyfriend of two years.&nbsp;Georgia and Annabelle, 14 and 13, are closer to home. All 3 are very supportive of their mom Heather and speak frequently of how much they admire her strength for leaving the Mormon community to live life her own way.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Former âReal Housewivesâ Stars Who Had Bad Experiences On The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=whitney-rose-s-daughter-bobbie><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Whitney Rose's Daughter, Bobbie</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>10-year-old Bobbie apparently loves being on the show, Whitney says, adding that "she thinks she's the star of it." Whitney explains that she gave her kids the choice of whether or not they would like to appear on camera during the filming of the show and Bobbi has been enthusiastic about the entire process since day 1. Maybe we'll see her on a season of her own someday?</p><h2 id=whitney-rose-s-son-books><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Whitney Rose's Son, Books</span></h2><p>Whitney Rose's younger child, an 8-year-old boy curiously named Books, is less excited about being filmed. "He wants nothing to do with it," the blonde beauty&nbsp;Housewife says. Instead, he is active in sports at his school, and his dad, Whitney's husband Justin, even coaches his basketball team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mary-cosby-s-son-robert-jr><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Mary Cosby's Son, Robert Jr.</span></h2><p>Mary Cosby and her husband Robert, whose extreme age difference and familial ties to each other (he was previously her step-grandfather) caused controversy and disgust, share a teenage son, Robert Jr.. At 16, Robert has a girlfriend on whom he showers extravagant gifts, like a puppy and a Prada purse. Mary is impressed with his taste, being the high fashion connoisseur that she is.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>âReal Housewivesâ Couples Who Divorced After Appearing On TV</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSmecqnprBlkZe8tsCMrZ%2BeZZOdtq2w0Z6lZqeWYr%2Bmrctmn6ito5rEqsLErGSsmZypeq2typ5knKGkrnw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-makes-match-attax-cards.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who makes Match Attax cards?</a>
