id=sub-header>July 2024 · 6 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><span><span>If the alloy is rich with pure iron, that melting point can go up to 2,750 degrees. <b>It Tetsutetsu was in real danger of melting, that means Shoto was stoking his flame to nearly 3,000 degrees</b>, a number which would make him hotter than most lava.</span></span><h2>Is Shoto attractive?</h2>The first time Shoto is mentioned, in-universe, as being attractive, is in Chapter 99 (from 2016), during the room competition. Mina calls him “the best looking guy in class”. Nothing too elaborate or hyperbolic.<h2>How hot can Todoroki get?</h2>Todoroki was able to melt metal in the fight with Tetsutetsu, the melting point of low carbon steel is 1410 ° C (2570 ° F) and high carbon steel 1540ºC . Todoroki probably reached or came close to reaching blue flames, which are +/- 1400ºC.<h2>Why does Shoto have a burn on his face?</h2>We know that Shoto's mother was driven pretty much insane by his abusive father, which resulted in her throwing boiling water in Shoto's face and scared the left side of his face.<h2>Does Todoroki get cold?</h2>Todoroki spends a lot of time covered in ice himself, so maybe his quirk allows him to use cryopreservation techniques on his own body to increase its resistance to extreme cold.<h2>Shoto isn't icy hot ❄️? he's spicy hot ?️?</h2><p></p><h2>How hot is Dabi's fire?</h2>Remember, flame temperature is often related to color. My Hero Academia Chapter 291 gives an approximate temperature for Dabi's flames. They can burn all the way up to 2,000°C (3,632°F). This shouldn't be a surprise to most readers.<h2>Can Shoto use fire on right side?</h2>Fortunately, Shoto is capable of using his other side to counteract the dangerous effects of whichever one he happens to be overexerting. Activating both sides simultaneously is possible as well, but lack of practice has made this awkward for him as it dulls his movements.<h2>Did Todoroki's mom burn him on purpose?</h2>Todoroki's mom burned him because he began to remind her too much of Endeavor. The constant abuse Endeavor put upon their family, both physically and emotionally, continually drained her over time. She took notice of Todoroki's prominent left side, which represented Endeavor.<h2>Why is Todoroki's hair red?</h2>Touya wanted to be like his dad, so him dyeing his hair back to red would be representative of him trying to make that dream come true. He's dyeing his hair to be the colour of a hero.<h2>Why does Todoroki cover himself in ice?</h2>He's not handicapping himself, but like adarsh said, he's covering his "fire side" with ice to show that he only wants to use his ice side.<h2>Does Todoroki take cold showers?</h2>Does todoroki have hot or cold showers? Fandom. Does todoroki have hot or cold showers? There is no in the middle.<h2>Why is Todoroki so cold hearted?</h2>In Chapter #188, Endeavor reveals through his internal monologue that overuse of his quirk heats his body, slowing his metabolism. It is for this reason he sought out Rei and her ice, knowing that mixing it with fire would allow his children to self-regulate their temperature...not that Todoroki actually does this.<h2>Can Todoroki freeze water?</h2>He can control ice, and has the means to melt by using his fire. Moreover since when vapor particles slow down (through lowering temperature) they turn to ice, he should be able to make it cold enough that they just turn into water, right?<h2>Why is Todoroki so loved?</h2>it's rewarding to see him make friends and get more and more comfortable being just a teenager and not let the past dictate who he is. he's trying to grow away from the childhood he experienced and giving his father a chance while also not easily forgiving and forgetting, i like that.<h2>How old is Todoroki?</h2>Todoroki is sixteen years old; he is the son of the number two hero, of for most of the anime. He has the most tragic known background story of all the protagonists. His parents married for the sole purpose of creating the new number one hero (quirks are often hereditary, more on that in the 'quirks tab).<h2>Why is Todoroki the most popular character?</h2>His quirky and unique character design easily makes him one of anime's most iconic figures. He is just that brilliant. With that being said, All Might's current status is awkward, to say the least. Many fans think it's rather humiliating for a legend such as himself to be but a sideline character.<h2>Why is Dabi hair white?</h2>His hair was crimson, but as he got older and went through more of Endeavor's harsh training and abuse, he got depressed and questioned why he was alive, and then he got Marie Antoinette syndrome, which was the same thing that made Kaneki's hair turn white during his time being tortured by Jason.<h2>What's Dabi's real hair color?</h2>He has white hair with a few red streaks at its crown that spikes upward around his head, hanging low over his eyes, which are thin, turquoise in color, and heavily lidded. Before the reveal of his true identity, his hair was dyed black.<h2>Why is Dabi stitched up?</h2>Dabi got his scars from a childhood quirk accident. He's really Endeavor's eldest son, Toya, and during a training session his quirk was too powerful for his own body and the flames overwhelmed him. He didn't have the ideal fire/ice combination quirk that Endeavor hoped for, but Toya's flames exceeded his Dad.<h2>Who is Shoto Todoroki's wife?</h2>Rei was once kind, caring, and loving towards Shoto and in return, he loved her deeply. She would always support Shoto such as trying to stop her husband's mad training methods and encouraging her son to become the man he wants to be, indicating her selflessness.<h2>Does Endeavor love his wife?</h2>Rei Todoroki. Enji is Rei's Husband. Endeavor bought her family over to marry her through a Quirk marriage. It's revealed that he chose her because of how her ice Quirk counters the drawbacks of his Hellflame Quirk.<h2>Does Todoroki have weakness?</h2>Weaknesses: Initially Todoroki was reluctant of using his fire powers due to his grudge against his father, due to which overusing his Ice powers caused him to lower his body temperature to dangerous levels. However after using both aspects of his power, this weakness is overcomed.<h2>What is Todoroki's hero name?</h2>Todoroki's hero name is Shoto, as he wanted to keep his real name as his hero name too.<h2>Can Todoroki produce blue flames?</h2>His flames used to be red but he trained so much to the point where his flames got so hot that they turned blue, that's why he has so many scars his flame is hotter than normal flame.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahsGaho2LAqbvTqGShp6Q%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./youth-of-the-nation.html>&#171;&nbsp;Youth of the Nation Lyrics Meaning</a>
