Athens, Greece.</strong></p><p>Giannis plays for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association(NBA).

Prior to being taken by the Bucks with the 15th overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft, he started playing for the club’s senior team in 2011.</p><p>He became the first player in NBA history to finish a regular season in the top 20 in all five statistics, including total points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. In 2016–2017, he led the Bucks in all five main statistical categories.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Giannis Antetokounmpo biography</h2><p>Giannis Antetokounmpo was born on December 6th, 1994 in Athens, Greece. He is a Greek-American because he is the son of immigrants from Nigeria.</p><p>His parents had left Lagos three years prior, leaving their firstborn son, Francis, in the custody of his grandparents. In Sepolia, an area of Athens, Giannis grew up.</p><p>Giannis and his older brother Thanasis sold watches, purses, and sunglasses in the streets to support their parents, who struggled to obtain employment due to their immigration status.</p><p>Giannis began playing basketball in 2007. Despite the fact that Giannis and three of his four brothers were born in Greece, they did not automatically acquire Greek citizenship because of the jus sanguinis system used by that country.</p><p>Adetokunbo was virtually stateless for the first 18 years of his life, unable to leave the country and lacking any documentation from either Greece or Nigeria. Less than two months before the 2013 NBA Draft, on May 9, 2013, he was finally granted Greek citizenship.</p><p>His surname officially changed to “o” once he was granted Greek citizenship in 2013, which is the Greek transliteration of Adetokunbo. This name was then transliterated letter-for-letter and written as Antetokounmpo on his Greek passport.</p><p>Giannis is a slang term for the Greek name Ioannis (John). His last name was difficult for many people to say, therefore he immediately earned the nickname “Greek Freak”. Antetokounmpo has dual citizenship as he is also a citizen of Nigeria, having obtained his Nigerian passport in 2015.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Giannis Antetokounmpo age</h2><p>Giannis was born in 1994.

Giannis has been chosen for six All-Star games, including two years where he led the Eastern Conference in voting and was chosen as an All-Star captain.</p><p>Giannis is one of the most decorated players in NBA history. He shared the NBA Most Valuable Player Award with LeBron James and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 2019 and 2020, making him the only player ever to win two MVP awards before turning 26.</p><p>He became only the third player, after Michael Jordan (1988) and Hakeem Olajuwon (1994), to win both accolades in the same season when he won the NBA MVP and Defensive Player of the Year in 2020.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Giannis Antetokounmpo girlfriend</h2><p>Giannis is currently in a relationship with <a href=#>Mariah Riddlesprigger</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Giannis Antetokounmpo children</h2><p>Giannis has two children; <a href=#>Liam Charles Antetokounmpo and Maverick Shai Antetokounmpo</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Giannis Antetokounmpo parents</h2><p>Giannis was born to <a href=#>Charles Antetokounmpo and Veronica Antetokounmpo</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Giannis Antetokounmpo siblings</h2><p>Giannis has four siblings; Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Kostas Antetokounmpo, Francis Antetokounmpo and Alex Antetokounmpo.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Giannis Antetokounmpo net worth</h2><p>Giannis has a net worth estimated to be about $70 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqCgmqaensBurc2tnK2nm6TCr7nPqGSboZ9irqixjKGcop%2BYqXqotdGlnauhlaOxbrzAq5ynrKNisKm1y52pnqZdo7K1edaoqa2gXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./glenn-foley-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Glenn Foley Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a>
