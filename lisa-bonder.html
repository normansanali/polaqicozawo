Between their split in 1995 and her pregnancy announcement in the fall of 1997, they were separated for two years.</p><p>Bonder is said to marry Kirk solely for financial reasons. Darrien Iacocca, the wife of industrialist Lee Iacocca, had told her that she had simply dreamed of being the “last Mrs. Kerkorian,” and that all of the lands could be hers.</p><p>But, when she was speaking with Kerkorian’s pals, her actual plans were revealed: she was exploiting Kerkorian to become the richest lady in the world. Rempel, Kerkorian’s acquaintance, clarified the situation.</p><p>Bonder, on the other hand, had persuaded Kerkorian to marry her, and they were married. Bonder became pregnant after her marriage and claims Kerkorian as her biological father. Kirk, on the other hand, was certain that he was not the biological father of the daughter and had done DNA testing to prove it.</p><p>The findings came in, and Steve Bing was shown to be the biological father. In 1999, the couple divorced. Even though he had agreed to 30-day contract marriage with a scheduled divorce and had stated that he would maintain the child with $50,000 per month. He had also contributed an additional $1.2 million for remodeling changes.</p><p>From 1998 to 1999, Lisa was in a relationship with Steve Bing. They have a daughter as well.</p><p>She married Tom Kreiss on January 10, 1988, but the couple split shortly after. Taylor Jennings Kreiss was their other child (b. 1989).</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Retired Tennis Player & Celebrity Wife</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Sascha Grabow</a></h3>Sascha Grabow estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
