Succession, however, is not the type of show to put any kind of mental health diagnosis on the table, perhaps matching what its characters would think of that.</strong></p><p>Correspondingly, What does boar on the floor mean? The most recent episode of HBO’s Succession, “Hunting,” will be most remembered for one phrase: “boar on the floor.” That’s the catchy name of the “game” that the Waystar Royco mogul Logan Roy (played by Brian Cox) inflicts on his potentially traitorous underlings, forcing some of them to oink like piggies and scuffle</p><p>Next, What disorder does Kendall Roy have?</p><p>Its true protagonist is Kendall, the loveable yet damaged middle child of a narcissistic abuser, the patriarch of the Roy family, Logan Roy. Logan has four children, all of whom jockey and dance for his affection, and each of whom have internalized his narcissistic abuse in different manifestations. Logan’s firstborn,</p><p>Is Kendall Roy manic? Earlier in the season, Kendall was on a manic high, feeding himself delusional ideas and filtering the people closest to him so that he would not feel threatened by reality. But now, faced with the growing realization that he has been betrayed by his siblings and his father, he is plummeting to a new low.</p><p>Regarding this, Is Kendall Roy’s son autistic? Iverson Roy is the son of Kendall and Rava Roy, and the younger brother of Sophie Roy. Iverson is likely on the Autism spectrum.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_Roman_and_Gerri_get_together></span><strong>Do Roman and Gerri get together?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gerri, who’s known to be upfront and career-driven, does not have a love interest in the show, though it seems her and Roman could get together at some point. When asked about their relationship in an Oct. 14 interview with W magazine, Smith-Cameron said it’s highly unlikely that Roman and Gerri will ever be an item.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Logan_Roy_smile_at_the_end></span><strong>Did Logan Roy smile at the end?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Season two ended with Logan and the rest of the Roys watching Kendall’s press conference. As Kendall betrays him, Logan watches the scene unfold, wearing a slight smile that just, almost, looks a little like pride.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_the_biographer_in_Succession></span><strong>Who is the biographer in Succession?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>2) The woman who is writing Logan’s unauthorized biography is played by none other than Jessica Hecht! a.k.a. Susan from Friends.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Roman_Roy_asexual></span><strong>Is Roman Roy asexual?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Many viewers have questioned whether or not Roman is actually asexual—someone who doesn’t experience sexual attraction and/or doesn’t desire sexual contact—but the character nor the actor playing him has officially defined his sexuality.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Logan_Roy_an_abusive_father></span><strong>Is Logan Roy an abusive father?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Logan Roy ended Season 3 with a devastating blow against his children—the latest in a brutal pattern of abuse that prompted a childlike plea from his youngest, most toxic son.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Shiv_Roy_became_CEO></span><strong>Does Shiv Roy became CEO?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Crowned President of Domestic Operations in episode two, Shiv has been happily doing daddy’s dirty work to help cover up horrific accusations of of systemic sexual abuse. She is presented as the sensible, untarnished new face of Waystar – and Logan’s convenient favourite (“his only daughter”).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Kendall_Roy%E2%80%99s_girlfriend></span><strong>Who is Kendall Roy’s girlfriend?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>That would be Naomi Pierce, the media heiress with a vendetta against the Roy family (and Kendall’s newish girlfriend), whose modern, monochromatic style has become a refreshing counterpoint to the staid boardroom attire that prevails at Waystar Royco.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Kendall_Roy_shave_his_head></span><strong>Why did Kendall Roy shave his head?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>For Kendall, that control comes in the form of a new haircut to make it clear that he is no longer a part of his father’s corrupt world.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Shiv_and_Roman_twins></span><strong>Are Shiv and Roman twins?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Roman — Third Child, Mid-30s</p><p>Roman seems closer in age to his younger sister Shiv than his older brother Kendall.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_is_Kendall_Roy%E2%80%99s_son_named_Iverson></span><strong>Why is Kendall Roy’s son named Iverson?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mirror Character: Iverson to Kendall, being an obviously neuroatypical target of Logan’s abuse, and Sophie to Rava, having to act older to take care of her brother and in some ways her father. Named After Someone Famous: Iverson is clearly named after NBA legend Allen Iverson.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Roman_sleep_with_Geri></span><strong>Did Roman sleep with Geri?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When we first meet this stupendous non-couple, they are not actually sleeping together or involved in any romantic capacity, but the sexual tension between Kieran Culkin as Roman, the youngest in the Roy bunch, and J.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_is_Marcia_on_Succession></span><strong>Where is Marcia on Succession?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Marcia Roy</th></tr><tr><td>Real Name:</td><td>Marcia Roy</td></tr><tr><td>Originally From:</td><td>Beirut, Lebanon</td></tr><tr><td>Current Location:</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>Husband:</td><td>Logan Roy</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Logan_Roy_proud_of_Kendall></span><strong>Is Logan Roy proud of Kendall?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>So, how does Logan feel about his son double-crossing him? While the ominous smirk right before the Season 2 finale’s credits may have implied that a small part of Logan was proud of Kendall for having a killer instinct, he sure as hell won’t be taking it easy on him.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Marcia_leave_Logan></span><strong>Does Marcia leave Logan?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marcia wasn’t seen leaving the plane with Logan, as he reunited for his obedient children for the waiting press, but we can only assume she’s back in the family fold, her position stronger than ever.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Kendall_assistant_on_Succession></span><strong>Who is Kendall assistant on Succession?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fans of Kendall Roy’s assistant Jess Jordan have Jeremy Strong to thank for the character’s prominent screen time on “Succession,” actress Juliana Canfield said on Monday.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Kendall_Roy%E2%80%99s_assistant_on_Succession></span><strong>Who is Kendall Roy’s assistant on Succession?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Canfield has featured in the recurring role of Kendall Roy’s executive assistant, Jess Jordan, in the HBO comedy-drama Succession, first appearing in the show’s second episode, and continuing to recur throughout the first and second seasons.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Kendall%E2%80%99s_assistant></span><strong>Who is Kendall’s assistant?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Currently, Kendall’s only known assistants are Maria McGraw and Ashlyn Leon — but they don’t even work for her anymore. According to their LinkedIn pages, Maria worked for Kendall from 2016 until 2017, and Ashlyn assisted Kendall and Kylie for four months in 2015.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Logan_sleeping_with_Kerry></span><strong>Is Logan sleeping with Kerry?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Let’s also acknowledge how funny and casually misogynist it is that Logan lectures Roman about how a sexual relationship between him and Gerri is “disgusting” and she’s “a million years old” and this will make Roman “a laughingstock,” considering that it’s certainly been implied (though not confirmed) that Logan is</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_Roman_and_Gerri_sleep_together></span><strong>Do Roman and Gerri sleep together?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When we first meet this stupendous non-couple, they are not actually sleeping together or involved in any romantic capacity, but the sexual tension between Kieran Culkin as Roman, the youngest in the Roy bunch, and J.</p><h2><strong></strong></h2><h2><strong></strong></h2><h3></h3><h3><strong></strong></h3><h2><strong></strong></h2><h2><strong></strong></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1ktrR5yp6lnZmcoXqquoysrJyblajAqrvNZqSepqSWua3FjKKjpWc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jennifer-lopez-celebrity-colorist-tracey-cunningham-olaplex.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jennifer Lopezs colorist Tracey Cunningham swears by this $28 hair-boosting product - exclusive</a>
