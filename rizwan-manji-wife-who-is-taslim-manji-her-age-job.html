The married couple exchanged their wedding vows on 12 June 2002.</p><p>In June 2019, Rizwan gave a glimpse of their marriage and relationship. He wrote in the post, “Ok so on June 11th, 2002, a day before we were going to travel the world for a year, Tas and I decided to go to the courthouse in Queens and get married! Anyway, we had a lot of stuff to do as we were leaving the next day and we rushed to the courthouse just as it was closing!”</p><p>He added, “They told us we couldn’t get married today and we’d have to come back tomorrow. We had a flight out the next day and we thought it would be safer to be married as we were traveling the world together with a one-way ticket to Bangkok. We decided we would try to get up early and come the next day and hope we made our flight, We got to the courthouse! I think Tas’s brother and Dad were there, it’s been a while but I think her mom was out of town. We didn’t even have rings.”</p><p>Rizwan added further, ” I’m pretty sure all the staff thought we were getting married for my green card!! The wedding ceremony lasted about 20 seconds. We took a picture in front of some altar or something and then we rushed to the airport! I distinctly remember Shania Twain’s song “You’re Still The One” playing on the radio, with the lyrics “Looks like we made it!” as we were going to the airport. We ended up playing that song at what we call our actual wedding on August 8th”</p><p>The actor concluded the post, “Happy Courthouse Wedding Anniversary Tas! Looks like we made it, look how far we’ve come now, baby! Well I don’t know about made it but 17 years ain’t bad.”</p><p>In August 2021, on their 17th anniversary, Rizwan took to his IG and wrote, “17 years today! Who would’ve guessed it? I would say something sentimental but&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@taslimmanji</a> would hate it.
