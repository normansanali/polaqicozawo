Cruise</a></strong> professed his love for Katie Holmes when he was being interviewed by Oprah Winfrey, many members of the media became obsessed with the couple. As a result, there have been a series of incredible headlines about Tom and Katie ever since even though they've now been divorced for years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One mind-blowing headline about Katie and Tom actually stems from their divorce since it was revealed that <a href=#>Holmes agreed to a crazy rule when they got divorced</a>. As it turned out, that headline wasn't based on a rumor as the story actually was true.</p><p>On top of the rumors about Katie and Tom and the accurate reporting, some stories that made the rounds were partially true and somewhat false as well. A perfect example of that is the rumors and reports that went viral about <a href=#>the crazy way Suri Cruise supposedly was going to be born</a>.</p><p>Considering that Suri's birth garnered international attention, it shouldn't surprise anyone that the media has reported about Tom and Katie's daughter throughout her life. However, a recent revelation about Suri launching a different kind of career than her parents flew under the radar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-suri-cruise-doing-now>What Is Suri Cruise Doing Now?</h2><p>In the years following Suri Cruise's birth, there seemed to be loads of paparazzi who followed the child everywhere she went. As a result, there sadly are loads of pictures of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes with their daughter where it is obvious that Suri Cruise was trying to shield her face.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tom-cruise-katie-holmes-and-suri-cruise.jpg><p>When most people see a photo of a child feeling the need to shield herself from the media like that, it is distressing to see. As a result, this article isn't going to try to invade Suri's privacy in any way.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Katie Holmes Really Spends Most Of Her Time With Her Daughter, Suri Cruise</a></span></p><p>Fortunately for anyone who is curious about what has come of Suri since she was born into such a unique world due to her parent's fame, some information about her is readily available.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A perfect example of a fascinating piece of information about Suri's upbringing that is publicly available is that Katie has said she wants her daughter to have a normal life as Holmes had.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/What-Does-Suri-Cruise-Think-Of-Her-Moms-New-Boyfriend-Bobby-Wooten-III.jpg><p>“I try very hard because I am very grateful for my upbringing and my parents and siblings. I try to do what they did for me for my little one.”</p><p>Katie has also revealed that she feels like she has been growing up with Suri.</p><p>“It’s been nice that our ages fit… how do I put this? Every age that my child has been and my age at that time has been a good match. We kind of grew up together.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most recently, Katie was interviewed by Amazing Magazine in 2022 and revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what it was like for her to quarantine with Suri</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/katie-holmes-and-suri-cruise.jpg><p>According to Katie, she and Suri felt like "they were on a perpetual vacation." “We were also on a lake and there was a hammock, so I would wake up, sew, have coffee, take a nap on the hammock."</p><p>As interesting as it is to learn about Suri's upbringing, the really fascinating thing is that Suri recently seems to have given the public a glimpse at what she might want to do with her life. On top of that, it is cool to see that Suri's mom is the one who gave her the opportunity to show off her talents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is What Destroyed Tom Cruise And Katie Holmes' Relationship, According To Him</a></span></p><p>In 2022, a movie that Katie starred in, wrote, produced, and directed titled Alone Together was released. Given how much control Katie had over that film, some fans may have expected her daughter Suri to appear onscreen in the movie. While that didn't happen, Suri did contribute to Alone Together.</p><p>During Alone Together's opening credits, Suri's cover of the classic song "Blue Moon" can be heard. While it is pretty much impossible to deny that Suri's song appearing in the movie is an example of nepotism, there is something very compelling about her singing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of contributing a song to Alone Together, it turns out that Suri recorded another one that will appear on the soundtrack of Katie's upcoming drama Rare Objects.</p><p>When Katie was interviewed by Yahoo Entertainment in 2022, she revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how Suri wound up contributing to Holmes' movies</a>.</p><p>"I always want the highest level of talent. So I asked her! She's very, very talented. She said she would do it and she recorded it, and I let her do her thing. That's the way I direct in general: It's like, 'This is what I think we all want — go do your thing.'"</p><h2 id=who-are-suri-cruise-39-s-siblings>Who Are Suri Cruise's Siblings?</h2><p>Even though the media has mostly obsessed over Suri Cruise ever since she was born, she has two siblings through her famous father Tom Cruise.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Nicole Kidman And Connor Cruise: Everything We Know About Their Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During Tom's lengthy marriage to Nicole Kidman, the two movie stars <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">adopted two children together</a>. The eldest of the former couple's kids is Isabelle who was born in 1992 and then their son Connor was born in 1995.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Did-Tom-Cruise-Really-Make-His-Kids-Nanny-Sign-An-NDA_-(his-kids-with-nicole-kidman).jpg><p>According to reports, Isabelle married an IT consultant named Max Parker in 2015. A lot like Suri, Tom's eldest daughter who goes by Bella mostly avoids the spotlight. However, it is known that Bella is an artist and that she launched her own fashion line.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/connor-cruise.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also, someone doesn't seem to relish being in the public eye, Connor has been seen at events with his famous parents in the past.</p><p>Seemingly married to a woman named Silvia Zanchi, Connor has revealed some of his passions on social media. Clearly a huge fan of fishing, Connor actually has an Instagram page dedicated to his hobby that is called Connor's Meatshack.</p><p>As of the time of this writing, it is unclear if Isabella and Connor have much of a relationship with their sister Suri. Of course, if the siblings aren't close now, that doesn't mean that they can't bond later in life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edKuqaJlk6fCqr%2FEZpuooZ6ceq%2B71mZpaWpiYsGwuYykmK2hlWK1sLjMnqpmppWlvG6uwJuwaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-amazing-races-ryan-served-time-for-a-murder-he-didnt-commit.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Amazing Race contestant Ryan Ferguson served time for a murder he didnt commit</a>
