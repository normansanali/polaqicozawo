The Talks Today</h1><div id=sub-header>August 2024 · 5 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><h2 id=hogwarts_legacy class=smooth-goto>Hogwarts Legacy</h2><p>Hogwarts Legacy is a magical action RPG that was released in 2023. The game is developed by Avalanche Software and published by Warner Bros. Games under its Portkey Games label. It is set in the Wizarding World universe and is based on the Harry Potter novels. The game is available on platforms like PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S, and it is set to be released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch later in 2023.</p><p>The player takes on the role of a student at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1899. The game allows players to learn different magical abilities and spells, and explore the iconic Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The game is set before the events of the Harry Potter novels and players will encounter familiar characters and locations, including the Great Hall, Forbidden Forest, and Hogsmeade Village.</p><p>Avalanche Software began development on the game in 2018 after its acquisition by Warner Bros. in 2017. The game was first announced in 2020, but it was subject to several delays before its release in 2023. There was a lot of anticipation surrounding the game, and some pre-release gameplay footage was leaked onto the internet in 2018.</p><p>Despite the technical issues and side missions that received criticism, the game received generally positive reviews from critics. The game was praised for its well-designed world, compelling characters, and engaging combat system. However, there was controversy surrounding the game due to the views on transgender people held by J. K. Rowling, the creator of the Harry Potter series, and allegations that the game contained antisemitic tropes, leading to calls for a boycott.</p><h2 id=hogwarts_legacy_graphorn_location class=smooth-goto>Hogwarts Legacy Graphorn Location</h2><p>Within the Clagmar Coast region of Hogwarts Legacy, adventurers seeking to capture the elusive Graphorn can locate their den in the southernmost point of the map. Aspiring Graphorn hunters should direct themselves to the renowned Clagmar Castle Foo Flame, from where they can venture towards the southeast to ultimately stumble upon the Graphorn’s lair.</p><p>The Graphorn, one of the thirteen fantastical beasts that can be collected and added to a wizard’s Vivarium, is a formidable creature that inhabits mountainous terrain. Adorned with a thick and impenetrable hide, two formidable horns, and unusual tentacle-like extensions on their faces, Graphorns are uniquely equipped to survive the harsh and unforgiving landscape that they call home. These appendages not only aid them in capturing their prey but also serve as a means of nurturing their offspring.</p><p>Despite their imposing appearance, Graphorns are notoriously known for their aggressive nature, and it is exceedingly rare for a witch or wizard to befriend one. However, those who manage to establish a positive relationship with a Graphorn are likely to enjoy an unbreakable bond with a powerful and loyal ally.</p><h2 id=how_to_capturegraphorn_inhogwarts_legacy class=smooth-goto>How To Capture&nbsp;Graphorn In&nbsp;Hogwarts Legacy?</h2><p>Capturing a Graphorn in Hogwarts Legacy is no easy feat, as these massive and powerful creatures require a strategic approach to capture. Unlike the simple process of catching creatures with a Levioso spell and Nab-sack, a Graphorn cannot be easily contained. Instead, a wizard or witch must first engage in battle with the beast, much like capturing a Pokemon.</p><p>When confronting a Graphorn, it’s essential to be prepared to dodge and counter their swift and powerful attacks, such as swiping claws and tail slams. A combination of basic attacks, powerful spells, and throwing large rocks at the Graphorn can help bring down its health.</p><p>Once the Graphorn has been weakened, it will eventually tire and lie down, allowing for a chance to capture it. It’s then time to approach the beast with the Nab-sack at the ready. However, given the Graphorn’s tough skin and strange tentacle-like appendages, capturing it will still require considerable effort and patience.</p><p>Since Graphorns are not available until later in the game, players must first complete several mainline quests before gaining the opportunity to capture one of these magical creatures. However, once captured, a Graphorn is a formidable ally, capable of traversing the map and destroying anything in its path.</p><p>In summary, capturing a Graphorn is no easy task, requiring a combination of strategy and skill. However, the rewards of capturing one of these powerful creatures make the effort well worth it.</p><h2 id=hogwarts_legacy_gameplay class=smooth-goto>Hogwarts Legacy Gameplay</h2><p>Hogwarts Legacy, an exciting action role-playing game, provides players with a unique opportunity to explore the Wizarding World through the eyes of a student attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As players traverse the grounds of the famous school and its surrounding areas, they can visit familiar locations such as Hogsmeade and the Forbidden Forest.</p><p>At the core of the game lies the aspect of attending classes, which is crucial to the player’s progression. With four known Hogwarts Houses to choose from, Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, the player is granted access to their chosen house’s unique common room. The game provides different exclusive quests that are specific to each house, allowing players to enjoy a unique gameplay experience.</p><p>As the game progresses, players will notice significant visual changes to the castle’s interior and exterior, which are tailored to match the seasons. Additionally, the game features an adaptive music system that changes based on the location of the player character. As the player moves through the open world, they’ll notice notable differences in the specific common rooms that can only be accessed by players who choose each corresponding school house.</p><p>The game’s character creation system is extensive, allowing players to customize their character’s appearance, gender, and choose one of the four houses. Players may also customize their character’s voice, body type, and add accessories such as glasses during character creation.</p><p>Players gain experience points by completing various in-game challenges, including combat, quests, exploration, and field guide pages. Level progression allows the player to access and upgrade different spells, talents, and abilities.</p><p>House points play a significant role in the game’s plot, but they are not influenced by player actions. In summary, Hogwarts Legacy offers a unique and immersive experience for players to explore the magical world of Hogwarts and become part of its rich history.</p><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is for general informational purposes only.
