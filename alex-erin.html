He also started dressing up like a boy which made a huge impact on his social life as well. He started making friends and spending time with them. During his sophomore year, his mother’s friends asked him to get himself a chest binder which changed his life forever by listening to the advice. He looks more like a boy after the chest binder which boosted his self-confidence. Then, he that he was transgender and was happy to figure out his sexuality.</p><h4>Surgery</h4><p>As her parents told him, he would be getting surgery at the age of eighteen.
