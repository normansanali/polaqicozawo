Is Earl Moffett still alive?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>When it comes to reality television, it can sometimes be hard to understand why a certain series has made it big.</p><p>Some reality TV shows are ridiculous, but many shows introduce us to people facing off against real problems.</p><p>One of the best examples of a show like this is Pitbulls and Parolees.</p><p>The show is great for showing us people coming through a challenging time, to say the least, in the legal system. It helps us understand how challenging life can be to get back to normality for someone on parole.</p><p>Through caring for animals, we see many of those involved change.</p><p>One of the individuals on the show who epitomizes that is Earl Moffett. If you want to understand more about your favorite star from the TV series, then you should read on – we will break down what is available about this local legend.</p><h2><strong>The Origin Story</strong></h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-79965 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Earl-Moffett-Net-Worth-Pit-Bulls-Parolees.jpg.webp alt="Earl Moffett Net Worth Pit Bulls & Parolees" width=930 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Earl-Moffett-Net-Worth-Pit-Bulls-Parolees.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-79965 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>Born in New Orleans, Moffett, like many Americans today, grew up without a father.</p><p>Without that father figure, he fell into a path typically followed by American youths: he found himself on the streets with other children.</p><p>He found himself looking for ways to solicit their approval and would do increasingly risky things to try to gain their approval and acceptance. Naturally, though, this leads down a bad path.</p><p>That path was well and truly met when Moffett fell in with a gang that saw him arrested at the age of 17.</p><p>His charges? Armed robbery and attempted murder.</p><p>That is incredible to be charged with at 17; it can change your entire life for the worse. Imprisonment for something so serious is hard to try and explain away to the people we meet, including future employers.</p><p>Moffett was given a sentence of 22 years, and he served 11 of those years behind bars. However, this was not when the legal troubles ended for the New Orleans native.</p><p>He was again arrested after being out of jail and was found to have drugs – a common circumstance for offenders to find themselves dealing with. He was locked up again, and during this stint inside, he found himself in a heated argument with another inmate during a game of football.</p><p>In the ensuing melee, he lost the ability to use his right arm. However, despite the obvious challenges that he was facing, Moffett was keen to ensure that his future would be brighter than his past.</p><p>Through a special program put together by the prison, Moffett and others would get to spend some time with dogs.</p><p>Keen to find something to help define his life away from time spent behind bars, Moffett jumped at the chance to get involved – the rest, as they say, is history!</p><h2><strong>The Villalobos Rescue Center</strong></h2><p>The start of his transformation came during the parole program that he was entered into.</p><p>At the Villalobos Rescue Center, he would be given a job, his first ‘legitimate’ job in his life. <strong>Note</strong> – Villalobos Rescue Center was founded by <a href=#>Tia Torres</a>, the mother of <a href=#>Mariah Torres</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Tania Torres</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-77027 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tia-Torres.jpg.webp alt="Tia Torres" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tia-Torres.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-77027 class=wp-caption-text>Tia Torres – @Getty</p><p>Working for the center, he would be allowed to help canines who need a loving influence– someone who wants to care for them and look after them.</p><p>As a natural fit for the job, Moffett soon found himself being given a chance that he had been denied for the rest of his life.</p><p>Not only did Moffet get to show the world that he has a natural skill and talent for handling dogs, but he also got to show the people he met through the program that we should not always judge someone on their past deeds alone.</p><p>For people like Moffett, mistakes can happen – we all know someone who has made tough choices in life but who is not, deep down, a bad person.</p><p>Through his time with the Rescue Center, Moffett managed to turn his life around.</p><p>Like everything else in life, though, it was not without challenges.</p><p>A spinal surgical treatment in 2015 left Moffett facing a short period of addiction to help deal with the post-surgery difficulties he faced. This, though, was knocked on the head via a 90-day rehabilitation program.</p><p>Moffett spoke openly about his time trying to get clean on the Pitbulls and Parolees show. However, he believes that working with the dogs he has been working with was a key reason he got sober.</p><p>He had something to aim for, something to lose; it is hard to stop a man like Moffett when he has a mission in life.</p><p>Indeed, he even got involved in a 2019 case when a shelter dog bit a young girl; Moffett spoke of the positive impact that such shelters can have on dogs and was one of the best testimonies out there for showing the positive change that a rescue facility can have on a person.</p><h2><strong>Proof That Rehabilitation Can Work</strong></h2><p><br>Having become ‘famous’ thanks to reality TV, Moffett is one of the few people who can say that the profile reality TV brought to him has had a broad positive impact.</p><p>Many people get embroiled in reality TV and find that it does them no good, and often leaves them facing a losing battle to have society view them with respect. Moffett was the example of the perfect reality TV personality: someone with a real life to be heard.</p><p>He did not arrive on the show hoping to find fame or fortune but instead to help show that rehabilitation can work.</p><p>Many people will have used Moffett to inspire their journey towards self-improvement.</p><p>Having overcome a challenging upbringing and gangland lifestyle choices to deal with losing his right arm functionality, Moffett has transformed his life by doing something good.</p><p>Finding a calling that would change his life forever was one thing; finding it through a parole program shows that the system can work.</p><p>A desire to improve mixed with an opportunity to succeed is a powerful thing: Earl Moffett is a high-profile example of when rehabilitation does the job it is supposed to. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Earl Moffett – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>So, how much is Earl Moffett worth?
