Potomac</strong>.</a> The 34-year-old joined the series back in 2018 and has since become one of the shows leading stars. Although fans adore her clapbacks and hot takes, it seems as if they might be getting her in trouble.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During her time on the show, Candiace notoriously <a href=#>feuded with Monique Samuels</a>, leading to one of the worst Housewives fights ever! Although her fight with Samuels marked one of the biggest of the franchise, Candiace has also come for fellow co-star, <a href=#>Ashley Darby</a>, too.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'RHOP': Fans Call Out Candiace For Instigating Fights</a></span></p><p>The duo have been going at it since Dillard joined RHOP in season 3, and it doesn't appear as if there is an end in sight. During Ashley's most recent visit to Watch What Happens Live, she revealed that she is not friends with Candiace anymore, and here's why!</p><h2 id=candiace-body-shames-ashley><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Candiace Body Shames Ashley</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to Candiace and Ashley's very tumultuous relationship, it's evident that Candiace has added far too much fuel to the fire. In past seasons, Candiace has come for Ashley's "large forehead," similarly to how she's coming for Mia's "big feet" this season.</p><p>Well, things took a turn when Candiace referred to Ashley's post-baby body as "wide" multiple times, despite Darby making it clear that those remarks were hurtful. During Ashley's visit to WWHL, she made it clear that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the body-shaming comments</a> are definitely a major reason why the two aren't friends.</p><h2 id=coming-for-ashley-39-s-baby-journey><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Coming For Ashley's Baby Journey</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As if coming for Ashley's post-pregnancy body wasn't enough, Candiace Dillard has also had some choice words for Ashley's pregnancy journey. Dillard has referred to Ashley as a "milkmaid" when breastfeeding and called her post-baby body "wide", however, the issues came about before Ashley was even a mother.</p><p>Candiace <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">questioned Ashley's baby journey</a> back in season 3, wondering why Ashley continues to drink if she claims that she is trying to have a baby. This is where most of their underlying tension stems from, and it hasn't gone away since.</p><h2 id=the-husbands-got-into-it><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Husbands Got Into It</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One reason that Ashley Darby and Candiace Dillard don't see eye-to-eye is because their husbands don't either. Michael Darby and Chris Bassett have got into it a few times on RHOP, including last season's debacle where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael told Chris off</a> for Candiace's remarks toward Ashley, leading Chris to push Darby back.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans React To Nicki Minaj Co-Hosting The 'RHOP' Reunion</a></span></p><p>The duo attempted to resolve their issues during the season 6 finale, however, it's evident that these two are not ready to move on, and considering their wives aren't friends anymore, it seems as if they don't have to now.</p><h2 id=candiace-came-for-michael-39-s-sexuality><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Candiace Came For Michael's Sexuality</span></h2><p>Candiace has found herself getting involved with her co-stars family members far too often! This season, Dillard has come under fire for referring to Mia Thornton's mother as "low budget," however, it isn't the fire time she's come for a parent or spouse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During her first go at Housewives back in season 3, Candiace brought up rumors regarding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Darby's alleged actions with other men</a>, which clearly didn't sit well with Ashley. Although the rumors have since dissipated on RHOP, the damage has certainly been done.</p><h2 id=ashley-defends-monique><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ashley Defends Monique</span></h2><p>When Monique Samuels and Candiace Dillard got into it, it was clear that there would be sides chosen. Although Karen Huger was accused of siding with Monique, she made it clear that wasn't the case. Well, it seems as if it was the case for Ashley Darby.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is 'RHOP' Star Candiace Dillard Guilty Of Body-Shaming?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the girl's trip to Portugal last season, Ashley revealed to Candiace that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wrote a legal letter in favor of Monique</a>, which didn't sit well with Dillard. Candiace accused Ashley of using this as a way to get back at her for their constant feuds in the past, and Candiace was probably right!</p><h2 id=the-notorious-knife-incident><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Notorious Knife Incident</span></h2><p>During the infamous dinner party at Candiace's mother's home, she and Ashley got into it after Candiace was relentless over the Michael Darby rumors. Well, things took a major turn when Ashley called out Candiace for hosting a party at her mom's house, which sent Dillard over the edge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Candiace then brought up Ashley's drinking all before taking a butter knife and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">swinging it toward Ashley</a> before throwing it in her direction. This was easily one of the most explosive dinner party's on RHOP and is a major reason why the two aren't close anymore.</p><h2 id=candiace-never-takes-accountability><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Candiace Never Takes Accountability</span></h2><p>During Ashley Darby's latest visit to Watch What Happens Live, Andy Cohen questioned her as to why she and Candiace are no longer friends. Ashley mentioned the constant body-shaming remarks, and of course, her actions against Michael Darby, however, Ashley made it clear that while she can look past all of that, she would <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">need Candiace Dillard to take accountability</a>, which Ashley says she has not. While fans are certain the two will go head-to-head at the season 6 reunion, we doubt it will mend any bridges between the two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>'RHOP': Rumors Claims Eddie Cheated On Dr. Wendy Osefo</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdlsCpuMSyZJ2ZopfGbq3NnWScmZ6ZtqKvxGaboqSclr%2BlecCrnKesXZu%2FqrHNnapmmZ6uurC%2BxGapnpmcYrWwwdKerqKulah6sLKMqaatp52WsHA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./astroturfing-internet-comments.html>&#171;&nbsp;Why Governments Employ Internet Commenter Trolls</a>
