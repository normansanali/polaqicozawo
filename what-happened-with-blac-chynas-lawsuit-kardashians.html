Kourtney prepped for her wedding, Kim whittled her waist down for the Met Gala, and the family faced a $100 million lawsuit from Rob Kardashian's former partner, Blac Chyna. According to Chyna, the stripper-turned-influencer's career was "permanently damaged" by the cancelation of her reality show Rob & Chyna, which she alleged was orchestrated by the Kardashians and their influence over the network.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The verdict didn't end favorably for Chyna. The trial aired some not-so-savory, alleged details of the couple's relationship and family members had to testify. But despite the loss of the extra $100 million in the bank, Chyna's presence across social media and OnlyFans makes it seem like the model is not doing too poorly since the trial's conclusion. Let's see what she's been up to.</p><h2 id=blac-chyna-has-history-with-the-kardashians>Blac Chyna Has History With The Kardashians</h2><p>Once upon a time, Chyna and the Kardashians were in each other’s social circles.</p><p>In the original Keeping Up With the Kardashians series, Chyna even came on the show as a friend of Kim’s. At the time, Chyna was dating rapper Tyga, who was friends with rapper-mogul Kanye West.

She named the family’s matriarch, Kris Jenner, along with Kim, Khloe, and Kylie for blocking the renewal with the network, which she alleged led to a loss of millions in future income.</p><p>Kim and Khloe denied these claims in court, and the family countersued that Chyna had been physically abusive towards Rob during their time together.</p><p>Kylie took to the stand, testifying that she had been concerned about her brother during his relationship. She shared that her ex-Tyga, who had also previously dated Chyna, told her that his ex had allegedly slashed the rapper with a knife, <a href=# rel=nofollow>resulting in a 6-inch scar</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow title="The Truth Behind Blac Chyna And Tyga's Relationship And Breakup">The Truth Behind Blac Chyna And Tyga's Relationship And Breakup</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, Kylie claimed she had received death threats from Chyna in the past but did not report it to the police.</p><p>In another testimony, Rob took to the stand and spoke about a particular incident that he stated resulted in the demise of their relationship.</p><p>During two nights in December 2017, Rob alleged Chyna had attacked him with a metal rod landing several blows to his face and body, and wrapped a phone charging cord around his neck.
