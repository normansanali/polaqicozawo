But it was only after 2022 that he stepped into the international limelight, not as a musician, but as </span><i><span>Bling Empire</span></i><span> star Kim Lee’s ex-boyfriend — who allegedly “betrayed” her.</span></p><p><span>Learn all about him; his age, net worth, and more as you scroll down.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Keith Ape, Bling Empire Kim Lee Ex</b></h3><p><span>The name Keith Ape was first heard on </span><i><span>Bling Empire</span></i><span> season 2 after Kim Lee talked about a previous trauma from her past relationship. At the time, Kim had just broken off with Kevin Kreider, after she heard that Kevin was hooking up with another girl — just like her ex, Keith, who “betrayed” her.</span></p><p><span>Also, it was her past relationship with Keith that led Kim’s trust issues to run so deep. No wonder, she encouraged Kevin to take a lie detector test to prove his intentions with her.</span></p><p><span>However, Keith never confessed to cheating on Kim. But a lot of people have connected the dots and argue that such severe trust issues regarding infidelity don’t just pop up out of nowhere</span></p><p><span>Initially, Keith and Kim first connected through mutual friends, and since they were both private people, they immediately fell in love. But little did the </span><i><span>Bling Empire</span></i><span> star know that Keith would eventually become a reason for her heartache and trust issues.</span></p><p><span>“I was kind of like he did me wrong but I still held on. I’m damaged inside, I’m still in the healing process,” Kim explained to her mother on </span><i><span>Bling Empire</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>So, after a traumatic experience with Keith, Kim had finally opened up to Kevin Kreider by the end of </span><i><span>Bling Empire</span></i><span>’s season 1 and gave love a second chance by season 2, only to again be “betrayed.”</span></p><p><span>Prior to Keith, Kim was briefly involved in a romantic relationship with singer Dustin Breeding, a member of American R&B music group</span><i><span> B5</span></i><span>, in 2007.</span></p><h3><b>Keith Ape Wife Now</b></h3><p><span>Keith Ape has always been a private person.

Landing a few gigs here and there, his exposure to the genre, got him compliments from many rappers including the likes of Nas.</span></p><p><span>He then went under the moniker Kid Ash and began posting his music to SoundCloud and YouTube, hoping for that big break.</span></p><p><span>Finally, a chance encounter with Cohort rapper Okasian landed him the opportunity he was waiting for. Not soon after he was signed to </span><i><span>Hi-Lite Records</span></i><span> and was making mixtapes with them.</span></p><p><span>So, after 5 years of making music for others, Keith, in 2015, realized his track “It G Ma” and this was the song that went on to become one of the biggest international hits to come out of Korea at the time. And not only in Korea, but the song also climbed charts in the US and everyone from </span><i><span>Complex Magazine </span></i><span>to the </span><i><span>New York Times </span></i><span>wanted a piece of him</span></p><p><i><span>Hi-Lite Records</span></i><span>, founded by rapper Paloalto in 2010 has been shut down today. However, Keith was still involved with other labels including </span><i><span>OWSLA, 88rising, UnderWater</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Cash Only</span></i><span> the last we checked.</span></p><p><span>Also, he was in the group </span><i><span>The Cohort</span></i><span> alongside AM Kay, Bryan Chase, Coke Jazz, JayAllDay, Kangkook, Okasian, Oscar Lee, and Jeremy Quest.</span></p><p><span>In March 2022, Keith also released his single “All Alright” in collaboration with ZillaKami and SosMul.</span></p><p><b>Did you know:</b><span> Keith was a huge fan of Keith Haring’s art.</span></p><h3><b>Keith Ape Height</b></h3><p><span>Keith Ape stands tall at a height under 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm).</span></p><p><span>Mentioning his district features, Keith has long hair, and a tattoo-covered body, and he always draws a small square cross surrounded by a circle on his left cheek.</span></p><h3><b>Keith Ape Real Name</b></h3><p><span>Keith Ape’s real name is Lee Dong-heon.
