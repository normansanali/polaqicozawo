The "Tik Tok" singer opens up to <a href=#>Us Weekly senior music editor <strong>Ian Drew</strong></a> about <strong><a href=#>Nicole Richie</a> </strong>and <strong><a href=#>Paris Hilton</a></strong> almost ruining her chance at fame (she once appeared on The Simple Life with the BFFs), breaking into<strong> Prince</strong>’s house and the necklace she believes gives her psychic powers.</p><p><strong>"Tik Tok" is your first song, and it's a mega hit! What’s that been like for you?</strong><br>It's really weird… When I wrote "Tik Tok," it was just another song I’d written and I didn’t even know if it was that good. I tried to re-write it a few times. And then I just kind of started playing it for people and they were like, 'Oh, this is a party jam!'</p><p><strong>How does it feel to hear your first hit on the radio?</strong><br>It's amazing. It's everything I’ve worked my balls off for since I can remember.</p><p><strong>What is it about partying that inspires you so much?</strong><br>I write about everything. I write about guys I’m stalking, and I definitely write about partying just because I wrote this record in a period of my life where I was focusing on experiencing stuff and writing about it. It pretty much was my job for four years… Everybody in my band gets along so well, and it’s not about getting f—ed up or getting drunk or anything like that — yeah sometimes we’ll drink, but we’re always having a good time.</p><p><strong>You worked on the single with Dr. Luke, who has produced tunes for <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a> and <a href=#>Katy Perry</a>. How did that come about?</strong><br>He called me out of the blue when I was at home in the middle of filming The Simple Life when Paris and Nicole were at my house. Nicole actually picked up the phone and hung up on Dr Luke. Truth.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>What happened next?</strong><br>He called back, and Nicole was like, 'This is serious.' I moved to L.A. and started singing back-up to Paris and doing background vocals.</p><p><strong>So you stayed friends with her after The Simple Life?</strong><br>No, honey, we are not friends. We’ve just been connected on one too many places and levels. I don’t&nbsp;have anything against her. I think she’s really nice, but we’re just very different. I'm just not that kind of party girl. I’m a whopping good time and have been to a few pretty badass parties in my day, but it’s never about what I’m wearing, what brands I’m wearing… I think what’s sexiest is a girl in an old T-shirt and cut-offs. It’s funny and confident and sexy. You don’t necessarily have to be wearing spandex and a push-up bra and 10-inch high heels. I just don’t think it’s necessary.</p><p><strong>I heard you threw up in Paris' house.</strong><br>I barfed in her closet. I ended up going to her house for a party, and I thought it was a bathroom. I was dancing too hard. And it turned out to be her closet.</p><p><strong>Did you two get in a fight?</strong><br>No, we never had a fight. We’re just so different, you know? We come from opposite ends of the spectrum. I grew up in the valley, broke, running around barefoot and moved to Nashville and played music and really poured my heart out. Very different.</p><p><strong>What about Nicole Richie?</strong><br>They were both really nice, I just don’t think we would hang. Nicole was hilarious. I really liked her, but it’s just kind of like, what does an apple and a penguin talk about?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Besides Paris and Nicole, everyone is saying you are this year's <a href=#>Lady Gaga</a>.</strong><br>We’re both blonde! But anytime anybody’s going to compare me to a strong, talented, successful woman, I’ll absolutely take that as a compliment.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Was it true you born at a party in the San Fernando Valley in 1987?<br></strong>My mom had a bunch of people over because she was about to pop and then all of a sudden her water broke and out I came. Then she had to be taken to the hospital, so I just stayed with her best friend and hung out. Life of the party from the very beginning.</p><p><strong>Your mom seems cool.</strong><br>She's a badass. The only thing I asked for for Christmas is… my mom found my placenta and she crushed it up in a blender and made it into a necklace that I wear everyday. It's supposed to make me psychic.</p><p><strong>Is it true you broke into Prince’s house to get him to work with you?</strong><br>I did sneak into his house because I wanted to give him my demo. So I got his address and I drove up there in my grandpa’s Lincoln town car, parked it right in front of his house. I paid the gardener $5, he shoved my ass under the gate, and then I walked up and the door was unlocked, so I took the opportunity to let myself in. I ended up walking in on him in the middle of band rehearsal. He just kept on playing because he was in the middle of a set. He just gave me this look like, 'Who are you? Why are you in my house?' And then I waved my little homemade demo wrapped in a giant purple bow and set it on his table."<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Are you seeing anyone at the moment?</strong><br>I’m as single as a fox in the middle of the forest! And I desperately want to hang out with the fat guy from The Hangover, so if you could make that happen that’d be greatly appreciated.</p><p><strong>Zach Galifianakis is your celebrity crush?<br></strong>Yes. I like his awkwardness and his beard.</p><p><strong>What do you think it is about your sound that has caught on?</strong><br>It’s not pretentious, it’s not too serious, it’s just fun. When there’s a recession and times can be hard, dancing is free. I want to make people dance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKeoJFiwaK4yqxkmpqfqsFuvNSkoKefXZ67brzAq6CsZZieubW7zaxknKSfqLK1ecGrnJqjmaO0brXNraZmqKKeu6Sx0mafqK2jmnpzfJBpaWlpXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./marvin-gaye-death.html>&#171;&nbsp;Marvin Gaye's Death At The Hands Of His Abusive Father</a>
