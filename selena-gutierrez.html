On February 25, she turned 17 years old. This meant she was a Pisces by birth.</p><h2><span id=Parents_siblings_and_hometown_of_Selena_Gutierrez>Parents, siblings, and hometown of Selena Gutierrez</span></h2><p>Selena Gutierrez was born to an unknown father and Michelle Gutierrez. She was originally from Colorado, in the United States.</p><p>When it comes to her father, he is described by her sister as a ‘dorky’ father who wore a Charlie Chaplin-styled mustache and was only featured a few times on her Instagram. Michelle Guiterrez, her mother, is a very attractive lady who appears to be very young for her age.</p><p>Selena was raised with at least five siblings. Thalia Gutierrez, Shakira Gutierrez, and Cassandra Gutierrez were her four sisters. She also has an older brother named Enrique Guiterrez.</p><p>Nestor Sebastian Silva, Thalia’s son, was born on September 18, 2018. Other siblings of Selena, on the other hand, are married or dating. Her brother, on the other hand, is one of the family members who are most supportive of Selena.</p><p>Unfortunately, Selena’s parents miscarried and lost an infant the next day, on October 5, 1997.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun SCXW6128053 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW6128053 BCX8" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW6128053 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559738":40,"335559739":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>In terms of social media, Selena only had 4736 followers on Instagram.

Now that she has a second mouth to feed, she will undoubtedly require a source of income to support her child. She may still be in high school in March 2021, despite being 17 years old, but the question of which school she attends remains unanswered.</p><p>Furthermore, Selena Guiterrez was cast in MTV’s 16 & Pregnant. According to show alum Amber Portwood, the cast of the show earned $5,000 per episode.</p><p>According to that, Selena should be making a few hundred dollars less, if not the same.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_Selena_Gutierrez><span class="TextRun SCXW137381264 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW137381264 BCX8">What is the Net worth of Selena Gutierrez?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW137381264 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p><strong>This sum contributed to Selena’s burgeoning net worth of less than $100,000.</strong></p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Selena Gutierrez estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

The timeline of their relationship remained a mystery. With an Instagram post in April 2020, she announced to her fans that she was expecting a child.</p><p>Selena wrote in the post, “I’m overjoyed because I’m going to have a mini mee!! God has blessed me, and I can’t wait for my beautiful princess to arrive; she’ll be so spoiled!”</p><p>In addition, on May 23, 2020, she revealed a sonogram and expressed her joy at the news that she was expecting a daughter. Selena was five months pregnant at the time. Sean, her baby daddy, was also overcome with joy. He also shared on Instagram that he was expecting a baby, along with a sonogram of the baby from a few days before.</p><p>Selena will give birth to her daughter Dareli Marie Gutierrez on October 7, 2020.</p><p>Her relationship with Sean, on the other hand, was not in the right place. In the MTV show, she revealed that Sean abused and even cheated on her throughout the pregnancy. Her family forced her to decide between her and Sean, which she revealed in one of the episodes.</p><p>Sean was living in a Colorado home with Selena’s family at the time. But when she decided to relocate with Sean to Arizona, where his mother, Mary, lived, things changed. However, her sister texted her, claiming that Sean had cheated on her.</p><p>Sean was confronted by the teen mother about his actions. Sean, on the other hand, refused to accept the allegations of cheating. When Sean asked what Selena wanted, she replied, “be done with you.”</p><p>Selena revealed to MTV that they used to hit each other in their previous relationship. In addition, her family was enraged that Sean refused to admit his mistake. So, are Selena and Sean dating? Social media, on the other hand, tells a different story. They hadn’t been featured on each other’s social media for a long time as of March 2021. On her birthday, Selena last appeared on Sean’s Instagram.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Charles H.
