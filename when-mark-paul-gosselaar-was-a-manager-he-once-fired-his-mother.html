Gosselaar claimed that it was typical for kids to have their parents serve as bosses. The actor claimed it also occurred to him.</p><p>The problem, however, started when the Saved By The Bell actor discovered he was losing out on opportunities because of his mother’s poor management skills.</p><p>In meetings and auditions, he confessed that while his fellow performers were receiving strategic opportunities and professional assistance from their managers, he was not.</p><p>After some time, the actor, who was 19 at the time, had had enough and dismissed his mother. He fired his mother since it was simpler and easier for him to do so because she was a parent rather than a professional.</p><p>The actor generally praised his parents and his formative years. However, as soon as he started keeping track of and managing his career-related choices, he had some significant issues with his parents.</p><p>Due to differences in their careers and finances, the actor broke off touch with Lisa Ann Russell after their 1996 marriage. His wife, Russell, had a different perspective and decided not to criticize his parents because, in her opinion, they did a great job of raising him to be a great man. His mother, Paula, voiced her sorrow over her son’s actions to People in 1998.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table id=factsDetail class=highlight style=height:100%;width:100%><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Mark-Paul Gosselaar</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td>1st of March 1974</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>47 years</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height/How tall?<br></strong></td><td>5 feet and 11 inches</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father Name</strong></td><td>Hans Gosselaar</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother Name</strong></td><td>Paula (van den Brink)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gender Identity</strong></td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Is Married?</strong></td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Is Gay?<br></strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>9 million dollars</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Mark-Paul_Gosselaar_and_his_mother_are_now_on_good_terms>Mark-Paul Gosselaar and his mother are now on good terms</span></h2><p>Over two decades have passed since the start of the Gosselaar family conflict.
