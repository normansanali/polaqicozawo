However, he is probably best known for his album “Turn Around”, for which he won a Grammy Award. His career has been active since 1995.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Jonny Lang is? It has been estimated according to authoritative sources that the total size of Lang’s net worth is over $12.5 million, as of late 2016. The main sum of this amount of money has been accumulated through his successful career in the music industry.</p><h3>Jonny Lang Net Worth $12.5 Million</h3><p>Jonny Lang spent his childhood with three sisters on the family’s farm near Casselton, North Dakota. When he was 12 years old, his father bought him a guitar, and soon he began to take guitar lessons from Ted Larsen, a member of the Bad Medicine Blues Band, and after several months, he became a member of the band, which changed its name to Kid Jonny Lang & The Big Bang. Little by little, Johnny took over the leadership of the band, and in 1995, they released their first album with him, entitled “Smokin`”. The album was well received, which encouraged Johnny to continue in the same vein, and just two years later released the highly acclaimed blues album “Lie to Me”, which reached No. 44 on the Billboard 200 chart, and also achieved platinum status, which increased his net worth by a large margin.</p><p>Jonny continued in the 1990s with the album “Wander This World”, reaching No. 28 on the Billboard 200 chart, which also earned him a Grammy Award nomination. His next accomplishment was the 2003 soul album “Long Time Coming”, which became his best charting album until then, as it reached No. 17 on the Billboard 200 chart. He then made several line-up changes, before in 2006 releasing a gospel album – “Turn Around” – which won him a Grammy Award and topped the Billboard Christian Album chart. Seven years later, Johnny released his latest studio album “Fight for My Soul”, which was another success, as it topped the Billboard Blues Album Chart, while it also reached No. 2 on the Billboard Christian Album chart.</p><p>During his career, Johnny has become known for his live performances; in his early days he would play barefoot, but after several accidents and electric shocks on stage, he stopped that particular practice. He has held several notable concerts, including a performance in the White House, and also played at the inaugural Ball for the Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura. Johnny performed with Eric Clapton at the Crossroads Guitar Festival, and was also a part of the Experience Hendrix Tour, which is a tribute to the deceased legendary guitarist and singer.</p><p>Johnny`s net worth also increased through his collaborations, as he has worked with such musicians as <a href=#>Willie Nelson</a>, Andres Osborne, Steven Curtis Chapman, <a href=#>Cyndi Lauper</a> and many other successful musicians.</p><p>When it comes to speak about his personal life, Jonny Lang has been married to Haylie Johnson since June 2001; the couple has four children and their current residence is in Los Angeles, California. He has had serious problems with drug addiction and alcoholism. He became a Christian in 2000; subsequently he has dedicated several songs to his battles with substance abuse, and conversion to Christianity.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=interesting_facts readability=11.716694772344><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>Performing at Pori Jazz Festival, in Pori, Finland [July 2005]</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>2</td><td>Has three children - twins, Raimy and Saylor; and daughter, Renn.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>3</td><td>Son-in-law of Nancy Johnson (IV)' and Cliff Johnson.</td></tr><tr readability=1.4615384615385><td>4</td><td>Brother-in-law of <a href=#>Ashley Johnson</a> and Chris Johnson.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>5</td><td>Has three sisters.
