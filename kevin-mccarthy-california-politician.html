By 2015, however, McCarthy was a “staunch anti-abortion-rights advocate.” McCarthy is a supporter of the Hyde Amendment (a provision, annually renewed by Congress since 1976, that bans federal funds for abortion), and in 2011 co-sponsored a bill, the “No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act”, to make the Hyde Amendment permanent. This bill was especially controversial because it provided an exemption for funding terminations of pregnancies caused by only “forcible rape”, which prompted abortion-rights activists to call the bill a redefinition of rape. McCarthy opposes a California state law that requires health insurance plans “to treat abortion coverage and maternity coverage neutrally and provide both”, believing that this law violates the Weldon Amendment and other federal laws. McCarthy received a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee, and a 0% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America.</p><p>As a freshman congressman, McCarthy was appointed to the Republican steering committee.
