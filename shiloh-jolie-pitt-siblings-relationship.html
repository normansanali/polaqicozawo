Shiloh is also the first biological child of <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> and <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>, which means they're in a unique position as the oldest kid having to choose between their <a href=#>biological parents in the custody arrangements following Brangelina's ugly divorce</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/he-real-reason-why-shiloh-jolie-pitt-rejected-a-career-in-acting.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Real Reason Why Shiloh Jolie Pitt Rejected A Career In Acting</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Shiloh Jolie Pitt comes from acting royalty, but why has she resisted a career in acting?</span><p>Does Shiloh share any real common ground with their siblings? Are they staying close to their brothers and sisters in this uncomfortable post-divorce, mid-pandemic climate? Read on to find out for yourself.</p><p><strong>Updated October 2023:</strong> As Shiloh Jolie Pitt has gotten older, her sense of style and interests have changed. This should not be surprising given that most teenagers waffle on what and who they find interesting.</p><p>With these changing interests, the amount that Shiloh once had in common with her brothers may have changed over the years to have <a href=#>less in common as she has gained a love for fashion</a>, like her sister Zahara. But, that does not mean that the close relationship Shiloh had with her brothers has dissipated. Instead, it appears that Shiloh has a close relationship with her brothers and sisters.</p><p>With parents as famous as theirs, it is helpful to be able to relate to others who completely understand what that entails. Fortunately, fortunately for Shiloh and her siblings, they have one another, making for a bond that cannot ever be broken.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shiloh-jolie-pitt-39-s-close-relationship-with-the-boys>Shiloh Jolie-Pitt's Close Relationship With The Boys</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar50821233-1.jpg><p>Jolie has been open about the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiloh liked to dress like a boy</a>. It was never a secret and letting Shiloh dress how they felt comfortable was always the plan for Jolie and Pitt.</p><p>"She likes tracksuits, she likes [regular] suits, she likes to dress like a boy," Jolie explained. "She wants to be a boy. So we had to cut her hair. She likes to wear boys' everything. She thinks she's one of the brothers."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's 13 years later and Shiloh still gets snapped by paparazzi out running errands with her dad and three bros. Their connection can also be seen in what Shiloh chooses to wear everywhere from red carpet events to casual LA hangs with the family. While some siblings, especially Zahara, often rock glam looks at events with Angelina, Shiloh has been more likely to wear more masculine clothes. However, in more recent years, Shiloh's style has changed to where they wear gowns to red carpet events. Whether this is a permanent change or just experimenting with fashion is unknown.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/what-do-angelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt-think-about-shiloh-s-dating-life_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Why Did Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie Choose To Name Their Daughter, Shiloh?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>When the couple welcomed their daughter into the world, many were curious about her name.</span><p>These days older brother Maddox is usually off at college in Korea.

Despite being from a notoriously private family, the siblings have been seen getting accompanied to and from their classes by Jolie's former stunt coordinator, Oliver Crane.

They've been spotted leaving movie theaters together with an assortment of celebrity pals, and seem particularly close to Stranger Things star <a href=#>Millie Bobby Brown</a> (who's no stranger to making unexpected friends). Look how cute!</p><p>Shiloh also looks to Zahara for styling tips.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Shiloh loves music, dance, acting and lately, thanks to her sister Zahara, fashion," a source explained. "It wasn't always like that, but now she loves dressing up in her mom's clothes. Zahara is the real fashionista in the family."</p><p>It appears that as Shiloh has matured, their relationships with their siblings have evolved with her. As such, it likely varies who Shiloh is closest to depending on where their interests lie from day to day. And given that they come from a large family, Shiloh has options when it comes to who their trusted confidant is as situations arise.</p><p>Sources: lifeandstylemag, vanityfair</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqoaGcpLVuts6loJ5loJ7BtXnSopmloZ6cwG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9o</p></div><div id=links><a href=./matthew-moy-net-worth-2024.html>&#171;&nbsp;Matthew Moy Net Worth 2024</a>
