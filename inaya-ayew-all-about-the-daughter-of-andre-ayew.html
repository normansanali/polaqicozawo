Dede Ayew, also known as Andre Morgan Rami Ayew, was born. He plays for the Qatari club Al Sadd and is the captain of the Ghanaian national team.</span></h3><h2><span id=Gross_Value>Gross Value</span></h2><p>Inaya is currently pursuing her education and enjoying the comfortable lifestyle her parents have provided for her. Her father, Andre, one of Ghana’s richest sportsmen, has recently revealed his net worth. As of November 2022, he has a $15 million net worth.</p><h2><span id=All_regarding_her_parents>All regarding her parents</span></h2><p>Her parents are Yvonne and Andre Ayew. Her mother is a businesswoman named Yvonne Ayew. She is the creator and CEO of the women’s clothing lines Kynamah and Kyna. The brand aims to give women a sense of freedom in their attire. In 2014, her parents got their names permanently inked on their wrists.</p><p>Both of his uncles played professional football, and he is the son of Abedi “Pele” Ayew, a FIFA 100 member and three-time African player of the year.</p><p>Being the son of one of Africa’s best players, he was born into it. Andre experienced a lot of pressure as a child growing up as the son of a football hero.</p><p>Andre claimed in a podcast that he was raised under pressure and that because he knew he couldn’t change the situation, the pressure became a part of him. They also had high expectations of him because of his father, which was difficult.</p><p>Even if he put in a lot of effort and succeeded, he would still be known by his father’s name, which at first was difficult for him.</p><p>His main objective was to become well-known. He, therefore, put in a lot of effort and persevered, taking criticism in stride. He claimed that having a father who was the greatest African player of all time ensures that you will always have people who are envious of you, regardless of what you have done for them.</p><p>Andre thinks he has handled all that has happened to him well. He thinks that athletes who can’t handle pressure won’t be able to perform at their very best.</p><p>When he first realized how much pressure was on him to perform at the highest level and represent Ghana at the national level, he was twelve years old.</p><p>He was under a lot of pressure since everyone was watching him and telling him he had to be successful. He was questioned about how he could play like his father if he could be like his father and other things from a young age. It became Andre’s responsibility to prove to everyone that he could.</p><p>Andre appreciates music, especially music from Ghana. He likes R&B and hip-hop, and he follows most of the R&B, rappers, and singers from Ghana.</p><p>Inaya Ayew loves Shatta Wale the most. He claims that Ghanaians have been moved by Wale’s song, and he claims that after first being misunderstood, people now understand him, his ideology, and his approach.</p><p>His other favorite musicians, after Wale, are Stonebwoy and Sarkodie. Andre is happy that Ghanaian music is becoming more popular. He applauds their outstanding achievement and encourages them to continue their hard work in the area. The same ought to be done with music.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Taylor Kitsch Doesn’t Have Time To Date Or Wed</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Football Player</a></span><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jung Woo-Young</a></h3>Jung Woo-Young estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
