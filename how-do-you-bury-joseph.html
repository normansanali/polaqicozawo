Others insist that the statue should face the road to symbolize the act of leaving the home.</p><h3>What does burying St. Joseph mean?</h3><p>Burying the St. Joseph statue in your yard is believed to help your home sell fast. The earliest accounts of this practice actually reference the statue being buried in order to get someone to sell the property to the one doing the burying.</p><h3>What is the miracle prayer to sell a house?</h3><p>A popular prayer to sell a house is: “I wish to sell this [house/property] quickly, easily, and profitably and I implore you to grant my wish by bringing me a good buyer, one who is eager, compliant, and honest, and by letting nothing impede the rapid conclusion of the sale.”</p><h3>What prayer do you say to bless a house?</h3><p>The Blessing of a New House prayer includes the following: “Lord, send down your mercy and your blessing upon us here and upon this house.

While doing this, ask God to fill your home with His Holy Spirit and let everything that happens in your home be according to His will.</p><h3>Why is St. Joseph so powerful?</h3><p>St. Joseph is considered powerful because of his role as the head of the Holy Family and the father and protector of Jesus.

Once the house is bought, the statue can be given a special place of honor in the new home.</p><h3>How do you pray to St Joseph for a house?</h3><p>One prayer to St. Joseph for a house is: “St. Joseph, just and true, with a father’s care you raised the child Jesus, and with a husband’s love, you shared your life with Mary, his mother. I entrust myself to your care and place in your hands this request of mine to find housing for my family.”</p><h3>Do you bury St Joseph in the front or back yard?</h3><p>According to tradition, you should bury the St. Joseph statue in the front yard.
