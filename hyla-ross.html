She also got him to see a concussion expert, who assisted him in his recuperation.</p><p>Hyla had a partial abruption two months before her due date when she and David were expecting their third child, Harper, on August 26, 2015. As a result, she was taken to the Tallahassee, Florida hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU). Her placenta became separated from her uterus, necessitating an emergency cesarean birth (C-section). When David observed his wife’s condition, he got emotionally unstable and couldn’t stop the tears from streaming down his face.
