His exceptional performances continued, leading Napoli to their third Serie A title in the 2022–23 season, and he was named the Serie A Best Defender of the season.</p><p>The summer of 2023 witnessed another significant move in Kim’s career as he joined Bundesliga club Bayern Munich on July 18, signing a deal until June 2028. The transfer, valued at €58 million, made Kim the most expensive Asian footballer in history at that time. His contributions were evident as he scored his first goal for Bayern in a 3–0 victory over VfB Stuttgart on December 17.</p><p>On the international stage, Kim’s journey with the South Korean national team began in August 2017.
